# software_testing
This project is the culmination of my first foray into software testing. </br>
</br>
The 'documentation/' folder includes a discussion on methodology, issues faced and things learned,</br>
as well as various diagrams. </br>
</br>
All the test code written for this project is found in '/src/Planner/tests/testSuite'.</br>
All other code was provided as a learning tool.</br>
</br>
This work was created in collaboration with Jarryd Wimbridge & Carl Wagner. </br>
